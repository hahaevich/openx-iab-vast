#summary Introducing The Framework
#sidebar TableOfContents

The VAST framework is an actionscript 3.0 implementation of a series of classes that:

  * Control calls to the OpenX ad server to request and retrieve any number of VAST compliant video ads
  * Manage the process of tracking timing events as ads play, triggering the appropriate action at the required time
  * Translation of a VAST response into an appropriate playlist format

The framework is housed under the package:

     `com.bouncingminds.vast`

The following diagram illustrates the package structure of the framework:

There are 6 key packages that work together to request, parse and manipulate a VAST response from a VAST complaint ad server:

  # The VAST *model*
  # Ad *Schedule*
  # Ad *Tracking*
  # *Playlist* management
  # *Server* control
  # *Display* management
