#summary Introducing The Framework
#sidebar TableOfContents

The VAST framework is an actionscript 3.0 implementation of a series of classes that:

  * Control calls to the OpenX ad server to request and retrieve any number of VAST compliant video ads
  * Manage the process of tracking timing events as ads play, triggering the appropriate action at the required time
  * Translation of a VAST response into an appropriate playlist format

The framework is housed under the package:

     `com.bouncingminds.vast.*`

The following diagram illustrates the package structure of the framework:

There are 6 key packages that work together to request, parse and manipulate a VAST response from a VAST complaint ad server:

  # The VAST *model*
  # Ad *Schedule*
  # Ad *Tracking*
  # *Playlist* management
  # *Server* control
  # *Display* management

===1. The VAST Model Package===

The Model package contains a series of classes that define the VAST data model: 

  * `VideoAdServingTemplate` - the controller class that coordinates calls to and parsing of responses back from VAST compliant ad servers
  * `VideoAd` - The high level grouping object that represents one video ad to play at some point within a stream. The grouping may contain a linear video ad and an associated companion ad(s), or a non-linear ad (e.g. overlay), optional associated linear ad (triggered when the overlay is clicked) and associated companion ad(s)
    * `TrackedVideoAd` - an individual video ad element that is to be tracked as it plays - there are three types of tracked video ad:
      * `LinearVideoAd` - represents the notion of a linear video ad (which is a `TrackedVideoAd`)
        * `MediaFile` - encapsulates the definition of the "media file" that is to be played as the linear video ad
      * `CompanionAd` - defines an associated display ad that is to be shown outside of the player (on the web page) as a linear or non-linear ad is played
      * `NonLinearVideoAd` - encapsulates the notion of an overlay style (non-linear) video ad (that is also of type TrackedVideoAd)
    * `TemplateLoadListener` - the interface that must be implemented by a player to be notified when the VAST data has been loaded or a failure to load has occurred
