#summary Introducing The Framework

The VAST framework is an actionscript 3.0 implementation of a series of classes that:

  * Control calls to the OpenX ad server to request and retrieve any number of VAST compliant video ads
  * Manage the process of tracking timing events as ads play, triggering the appropriate action at the required time
  * Translation of a VAST response into an appropriate playlist format

The framework is housed under the package:

     `com.bouncingminds.vast`

The following diagram illustrates the package structure of the framework:
