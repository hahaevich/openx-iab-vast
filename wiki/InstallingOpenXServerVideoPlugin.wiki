#sidebar TableOfContents

To setup OpenX so that it is ready to serve Video Ads:

  * The necessary changes to OpenX core have been committed to the OpenX source repository and will only be available as standard in OpenX 2.8.2. OpenX 2.8.2 has not been release yet, here is a link to OpenX 2.8.2 Release 
Candidate 5 (Release Candidate means its NOT the final official release of OpenX 2.8.2 - so its not for production use - just beta testing) [http://www.bouncingminds.com/beta/openx-rc/openx-2.8.2-rc5.tar.gz] 
  * The videoAds plugin will automatically be installed so the steps below are NOT necessary
