#summary Implementing a Custom Player
#sidebar TableOfContents

A generic VAST actionscript 3.0 framework has been provided to allow custom player implementations.

The framework has evolved through the development of the Flowplayer and JW Player Ad Streamers. The current incarnation of the framework is very much in an *alpha* form - it's a little rough and ready.

We'll be revisiting the framework shortly, re-factoring and generally cleaning it up.

You can download the latest version of the framework [X here].
