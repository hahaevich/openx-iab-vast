#summary Examples for the Longtail JWPlayer Ad Streamer
#sidebar TableOfContents

A range of examples are detailed below. These examples illustrate the various configurations that the player can accommodate to deliver instream (and shortly overlay plus companion) advertising across live and on-demand streams.

===Zones===

To support these examples, several "zones" have been defined on our [http://openx.bouncingminds.com/openx OpenX instance]:

  # RTMP zones
    * zone '1': Instream video - pre, mid or post roll
    * zone '2': Overlay - click to play video
    * zone '3': Overlay - click to go to a website
    * zone '4': Instream video with companion ad
  # HTTP Download zones
    * to be defined

===Examples===

Two instances of each example are provided. 

To view the RTMP example, click on the "RTMP" link - for the HTTP download example, click on the "HTTP" link:

  # A pre-roll ad only ([http://www.bouncingminds.com/plugins/longtail/jwplayer/openx/examples/rtmp-example01.html RTMP], HTTP)
  # A pre-roll ad and a show stream ([http://www.bouncingminds.com/plugins/longtail/jwplayer/openx/examples/rtmp-example02.html RTMP], HTTP)
