#summary Tracking Time and Events
#sidebar TableOfContents

Once the configuration data has been successfully loaded, setup the mechanism that will be used by the framework to track time based events as the stream(s) play.

Timed events are used by the VAST framework to determine when mid roll and non-linear ads (e.g. overlays) are to be displayed. They are also used to identify when tracking events (`start`, `1st quartile`, `mid point`, `3rd quartile` and ad `complete`) are to be logged by the OpenX server.

When the VAST framework loads the ad data from the OpenX server, it creates a time tracking table that lists all of the ad related events that are to be tracked per stream and the time each is to be triggered. When a call is made to the VAST framework to `processTimeEvent`, this tracking table is reviewed to see if the point in time matches anything that is listed in that table. If it is, the related VAST event is fired.

Different players allow time based events to be tracked and processed in different ways:

  * JW Player allows a listener interface to be registered to receive callbacks every 10th of a second - these callbacks are fired every 10th of a second and it is up to the VAST framework to determine if they map to a point in time that is relevant for the streams and ads being played
  * Flowplayer alternatively allows "cuepoints" to be set on a clip at a precision of 1000th of a second - when the specified point in time occurs the "cuepoint" interface is called so that the event can be processed - in this model, the VAST framework only receives a callback when the point in time has been mapped to a specific ad event that the framework must track
