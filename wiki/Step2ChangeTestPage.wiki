To modify your test page to use the data in your newly installed OpenX instance and the zones that you defined:

  # Edit the test HTML page
  # Modify the OpenX server URL so that it points to your instance
{{{
<script language="JavaScript">
flowplayer("a.example", "dist/flowplayer-3.1.0.swf", {

  # Modify netConnectionURL so that it points to the base location of your FMS/CDN server:

            // and the duration of each. Any number of streams can be identified and ads are
            // sequenced against each. Identify your programme streams and the duration
            // of each
            
            streams: [ { file:'mp4:bbb_640x360_h264.mp4', duration:'00:09:56' } ],

  # Ensure that the zone parameter is the zone id that matches the inline zone id you configured on your OpenX instance:

            adSchedule: [
                { zone: '22',              // A 'zone' defined in YOUR OpenX Ad server

  # You can check that your OpenX instance is returning the VAST response by calling the following [http://yourservername/path_to_openx_install/www/delivery/fc.php?script=bannerTypeHtml:vastInlineBannerTypeHtml:vastInlineHtml&zones=name%3DZONEID&nz=1&source=&r=14730862&block=1&format=vast&charset=UTF-8 url format]. You can see   [http://openx.bouncingminds.com/openx/www/delivery/fc.php?script=bannerTypeHtml:vastInlineBannerTypeHtml:vastInlineHtml&zones=try3%3D1&nz=1&source=&r=14730862&block=1&format=vast&charset=UTF-8 an example OpenX VAST response here]. Remember you need to change have the correct ZONEID in the url.
  # Fire up your test page - you should now see a pre-roll ad served from your OpenX instance along with your main programme stream
