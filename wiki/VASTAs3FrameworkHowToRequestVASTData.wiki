#summary Obtain the VAST Ad Data From the Ad Server

The following code snippet make a request to the OpenX Ad Server.

{{{
_openXAdServer = AdServerFactory.getAdServer(AdServerFactory.AD_SERVER_OPENX) as OpenXAdServer;
_openXAdServer.initialise(_openXConfig);
_openXAdServer.loadVideoAdData(this, this);
}}}

An instance of the `OpenXAdServer` class is obtained from the `AdServerFactory`. Once that is obtained, the configuration for the framework is passed into the instance via the `initialise` method. The key piece of configuration data that is extracted during initialisation is the URL of the OpenX ad server instance (identified in the configuration file as `vastServerURL`)

When the VAST data is loaded, two methods are made available by the `TemplateLoadListener` interface to signal completion of the task:

{{{
public function onTemplateLoaded():void;
public function onTemplateLoadError(event:Event):void;
}}}

`onTemplateLoaded` is called when the template data has been successfully loaded while `onTemplateLoadError` is called if the load fails.
