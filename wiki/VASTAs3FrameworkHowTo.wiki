To illustrate how to use the VAST framework, we'll walk through the key implementation points in the JW Player plugin - the `OpenXAdStreamer`.

==The Key Interfaces==

The first thing you will notice about the JW Player plugin, is that it implements three interfaces that are central to the way the VAST framework works:

{{{
public class OpenXAdStreamer 
          extends MovieClip 
          implements PluginInterface, VideoAdDisplayController, TemplateLoadListener, TrackingEventListener {
}
}}}
